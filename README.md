# Baby on a plane: Is it Rude?

I chose the question **"In gerneral, is it rude to bring a baby on a plane?"** because it's a relatable and often debated topic in travel etiquette, especially in recent years, there have been many disputes over the issue of babies crying on planes, and even conflicts have occurred on planes. I found it interesting that the majority of people do **not** find it rude and show their tolerant side, despite common complaints in public forums and media.

## What the chart shows

My Datawrapper chart illustrates:
- **592** said "No, not at all rude"
- **182** said "Yes, somewhat rude"
- **75** said "Yes, very rude"
- **191** did not answer

This suggests most poeople are understanding toward parents flying with babies.

This is a chart I made in quiz question 5.
